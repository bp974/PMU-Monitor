RUNNING THE PROGRAM:
	Windows/MAC:
		Double click the Jar file to open and run the program
	Linux/Unix:	
		From terminal navigate to location of the Jar and then run
		java -jar <filename>.jar
		
USING THE PROGRAM:
	To start the simulation select the event type you wish to simulate (or leave blank for random event type).
	Select an area you wish to see simulations from. 
	Select the number of PMU's you would like to simulate. 
	Currently 'Variance of Noise' has not been implemented yet.
	Hit the start button to start the simulation.
		Any time during simulation you can select the pause button to pause the simulation and then start again by
		pressing the start button. 
		
PREDICTION:	
	During the simulation the program will look for anomalies in the voltage/frequency.
	After finding a disturbance the program will highlight that instance in bold red and use k-Nearest Neighbor
		classifier to classify the disturbance type that was shown on the screen.  
	The bottom right frame will show information about the PMU with the largest disturbance. It will show the 
		actual disturbance type as well as the predicted disturbance type.
	
The user can then start the simulation process over again by changing some of the previously selected data.

FUTURE WORK:
	Allow the user to create a Disturbance with the disturbance button. 
	Allow the user to add noise variance to the instances.
